# BattleSimulator

This is a Battle Simulator. It simulated battles between 2 combatants.

The only input the user gets is to choose a name for each combatant.

## Usage

    ./battleSimulator.php

## Requirements

This requires `PHP 5.4` with `readline` support.
It will not work with `PHP <= 5.3.*`, and it will not work without `readline`.

If you want to run the tests you need `phpunit 3.6`. You can run the tests just by typing

    phpunit

In the project root.
